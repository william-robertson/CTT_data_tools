##    Code to examine the relationship between RSS values and distance for a given study area using an exponential decay model
##      -- Analysis in Ecology and Evolution Paper is based on data from a test with of a radio transmitter at 135 known locations distributed throughout the Guam Network 
##         -- At each test location a transmitter was held stationary for a 5-minute time period 
##            -- Removed first and last minute of each test to ensure that times matched between tests and the node network
##            -- For each test, calculated an average RSS value for the 3-min middle time period individually for each node that detected the transmitter
##        
##
##    1st step: Data preparation - isolates raw RSS data from node network that is associated with test data 
##      -- Creates the data file that was published with this paper at: https://doi.org/10.5066/P94LQWIE 
##            -- Data associated with this test is coded as 'A' in the column 'DataSet'
##    2nd step: Exponential Decay Model - uses the dataset created in step 1 to examine the relationship between RSS values and distance for a node network
##
##
##    Files Needed
##        1. TestInfo.csv: file with test information that is saved in the working directory defined below
##            - For each unique test location there should a row of information associated with each of the 3 inner minutes of that test
##                - meaning that each test will have 3 rows of information with each row identifying one of the 3 inner minutes of the test (see TestInfo_Example.csv)
##            - Columns
##                -- TagId: unique identifier of the transmitter used during the specified test
##                -- TestId: unique identifier given to each of the unique locations where a test was conducted
##                -- Date: date when the specified test was conducted
##                -- Start.Time: time when the specified test was started
##                -- End.Time: time when the specified test was ended
##                -- Min: 1-minute time period of the specified test
##                -- Hour: hour of the the specified minute of the test
##                -- TestUTMx: Easting location of the specified test 
##                -- TestUTMy: Northing location of the specified test 
##
##       2. BeepData.rds: file with the raw RSS values collected by the node network during the time period of the test. The file should be saved in the working directory defined below
##            -- output file from Import_beep.data.Github.R script (see BeepData_Example.rds)
##            -- If using a file created from another source the following columns are needed in the specified format: 
##                -- TagId: Factor identifying the unique code of a tag
##                -- Time.local: POSIXct value in the format: "2021-12-29 09:02:51" that identifies the unique datetime stamp (IN THE LOCAL TIME ZONE OF THE STUDY) when the tag was detected by the specified node
##                    ***** If you don't have a column with the local time, but only UTC time - then change lines 42-44 in Functions_RSS.Based.Localizations.R from 'Time.local' to 'Time' ************
##                    ***** BUT be sure that Dates and Times in TestInfo.csv are also in UTC time and not local time *********
##                -- NodeId: Factor identifying the node in the network that detected the specified tag
##                -- TagRSSI: Integer indicating the RSS value (in dB) of the signal of the specified tag received by the specified node
##
##       3. Nodes.csv: file with a list of all nodes in your network and their UTM locations. The file should be saved in the working directory defined below
##            - Columns
##                -- NodeId: unique identifier of given to each node 
#                 -- NodeUTMx: Easting location of the specified node
##                -- NodeUTMy: Northing location of the specified node 
##            - Other columns can also be in the file for your reference 
##            - If Node names are being converted to scientific notation in Excel open the file with a text editor (e.g. BBedit) to change names to the correct format and save the file  
## 
##       4. Functions_RSS.Based.Localizations.R - R script with functions needed to run the code below - file should be saved in the working directory defined below    
##      
##  Important Output
##      1. Calibration Dataset that contains the average RSS values for a given node that detected the signal of a test transmitter at a known location
##      2. Model coefficients from an exponential decay model that show the relationship between RSS and Distance for a node network
##            exponential model formula: avgRSS ~ a * exp(-S * distance) + K
##                  a = intercept
##                  S = decay factor
##                  K = horizontal asymptote
